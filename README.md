### // SYSTEM_DIAGNOSTICS
**Translating rigorous Quality Control standards into resilient IT infrastructure.**
I am transitioning from high-precision Construction QC (ATTI/ACI Certified) to Data Center Operations. I don't just "use" computers; I dismantle, audit, and rebuild them with a zero-trust mentality.

* **Primary Mainframe:** Pop!_OS (Debian-based stability | Daily Driver)
* **Mobile Command:** Pixel 7 Pro running Termux (Zsh "Fortified" Config)
* **Research Labs:** Arch Linux (Rolling), Void Linux (Runit), Kali Linux (Pen Testing)
* **Secure Ops:** Tails OS ("The Ghost" | Secure Comms)
* **Network Hardening:** Netgear R7000 running FreshTomato (NVRAM/CLI Config)

### // MISSION_LOG
1.  **Career Pivot:** Leveraging ATTI Field & ACI Level 1 discipline to master Linux Systems Administration.
2.  **Current Studies:** CompTIA A+ / Network+ / Linux+
3.  **Sovereignty:** Establishing automated income & digital independence via "The Empire."
